You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, Astro framework, and UI/UX design for high-performance, accessible, and elegant web interfaces.

---

## 🧠 Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Apply UX design thinking to every UI decision.
- Use component-driven design with reusable, accessible, and well-structured UI.

---

## 🏗️ Astro Project Structure
- Follow Astro's recommended structure:
  - `src/components/` – UI components (modular, styled, accessible)
  - `src/layouts/` – Layout wrappers for pages
  - `src/pages/` – File-based routing for pages
  - `src/styles/` – Tailwind + utility styles
  - `public/` – Static assets
  - `astro.config.mjs` – Configuration + integrations

---

## 🧩 Component & UI Development
- Build `.astro` components with clean separation of structure, style, and logic.
- Use React/Vue/Svelte components when dynamic interaction is needed.
- Focus on:
  - Consistent spacing and visual rhythm
  - Clear call-to-action hierarchy
  - Visual feedback (hover, focus, disabled)
  - Form UX: labels, inputs, states, validation

---

## 🎨 Design System (Tailwind First)
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively.
- Base all UI decisions on:
  - Tailwind’s spacing scale
  - Typography scale
  - Tailwind color palette (use `theme.extend` for branding colors)
- Don’t use `@apply`; favor utility composition.

---

## 🖌️ UX/UI Best Practices
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity in interface design.
- Follow key UX laws:
  - Hick’s Law (limit cognitive load)
  - Fitts’s Law (make primary actions easy to reach)
  - Jakob’s Law (follow familiar UI patterns)
- Use a mobile-first, responsive layout approach.
- Create clean visual hierarchy using headings, color, contrast, and spacing.
- Use component props for layout control (e.g., `variant`, `size`, `theme`)
- Design with accessibility as a baseline, not an afterthought.

---

## 🪟 Layout & Page Design
- Leverage Astro layouts (`src/layouts/`) to wrap consistent structure (header, footer, sidebar).
- Use whitespace generously to avoid clutter.
- Apply consistent component spacing using Tailwind’s spacing scale (`p-6`, `gap-8`, etc.)
- Use motion sparingly (e.g. `framer-motion`) to enhance feedback.

---

## 📁 Routing
- Use Astro's file-based routing in `src/pages/`
- Dynamic pages via `[...slug].astro`
- Use `getStaticPaths()` for SSG pages
- Include a `404.astro` with branded fallback UI

---

## 📝 Content Management
- Use `.md` or `.mdx` files for pages with rich content
- Group related content into content collections
- Add frontmatter metadata for SEO and dynamic templates

---

## 🌐 Accessibility (A11Y)
- Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
- Ensure focus states and keyboard nav for interactive elements
- Use ARIA roles and labels only when semantic HTML isn’t enough
- Support screen readers with proper labeling, alt text, and form associations

---

## ⚙️ Performance Optimization
- Minimize client-side JS
- Use `client:*` hydration directives only when needed:
  - `client:load` for critical UI
  - `client:visible` for lazy hydration
  - `client:idle` for lowest priority
- Optimize all images with `@astrojs/image` or `<img loading="lazy" />`
- Use Astro's asset bundling for CSS & fonts
- Always test using Lighthouse + Core Web Vitals

---

## 🔍 SEO & Meta
- Use Astro’s `<head>` for page-specific meta
- Use an `<SEO />` component pattern with props like `title`, `description`, `image`
- Generate canonical URLs and Open Graph tags

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Write unit tests for UI logic and components
- Use Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end UX flow testing
- Implement visual regression testing for layout consistency

---

## 🧰 Tools & Integrations
- Tailwind CSS via `@astrojs/tailwind`
- `@astrojs/image` for responsive images
- MDX support for content-rich pages
- Framer Motion for subtle animation
- Form validation libs (e.g. Zod, Yup)

---

## 🌍 UX Deliverables for Arcom-style Project
- Design clean service cards with hover effects
- Build partner logo grids with accessible `alt` attributes
- Implement a sticky header with clear nav structure
- Use scroll reveal for service sections
- Build FAQ and Contact sections with accessible accordion/tabs

---

## 📈 Performance & Monitoring
- Audit performance via Lighthouse and WebPageTest
- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Set performance budgets
- Monitor runtime size of client JS

---

## ✅ Key UX/UI Conventions
1. Use consistent design tokens (spacing, colors, font sizes)
2. Group form fields with proper `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` when needed
3. Provide meaningful visual feedback on user interaction
4. Favor simplicity: reduce visual and functional noise
5. Always design with both desktop and mobile breakpoints in mind
